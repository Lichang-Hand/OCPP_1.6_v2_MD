# 8. Firmware and Diagnostics File Transfer

This section is normative.

The supported transfer protocols are controlled by the configuration key SupportedFileTransferProtocols. FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS (CSL)

## 8.1. Download Firmware

When a Charge Point is notified about new firmware, it needs to be able to download this firmware. The Central System supplies in the request an URL where the firmware can be downloaded. The URL also contains the protocol which must be used to download the firmware.

It is recommended that the firmware is downloaded via FTP or FTPS. FTP(S) is better optimized for large binary data than HTTP. Also FTP(S) has the ability to resume downloads. In case a download is interrupted, the Charge Point can resume downloading after the part it already has downloaded. The FTP URL is of format: ftp://user:password@host:port/path in which the parts user:password@, :password or :port may be excluded.

To ensure that the correct firmware is downloaded, it is RECOMMENDED that the firmware is also digitally signed.

## 8.2. Upload Diagnostics

When a Charge Point is requested to upload a diagnostics file, the Central System supplies in the request an URL where the Charge Point should upload the file. The URL also contains the protocol which must be used to upload the file.

It is recommended that the diagnostics file is downloaded via FTP or FTPS. FTP(S) is better optimized for large binary data than HTTP. Also FTP(S) has the ability to resume uploads. In case an upload is interrupted, the Charge Point can resume uploading after the part it already has uploaded. The FTP URL is of format: ftp://user:password@host:port/path in which the parts user:password@, :password or :port may be excluded.
